My friend Jim, from my local rocklet club, gave me a classic 
FSI Black Brant II kit (for an extremely reasonable price). The kit is in
great shape and I wanted to do it justice by building it extra special.

I haven't seen big chunks of balsa like this in a long time. The kit is really
a great example of high quality from 30+ years ago.
