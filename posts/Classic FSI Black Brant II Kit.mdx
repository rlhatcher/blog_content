  My friend Jim, from my local rocklet club, gave me a classic 
  FSI Black Brant II kit (for an extremely reasonable price). The kit is in
  great shape and I wanted to do it justice by building it extra special.

My friend Jim from my local rocket club sold me a classic
FSI Black Brant II kit for an extremely reasonable price at the club's annual
event this year. The kit is in great shape and I wanted to do it justice by building
it extra special.

I haven't seen big chunks of balsa like this in a long time. The kit is really
a great example of high quality from 30+ years ago but the balsa has some very deep grain
so the finishing stages will be a bit more challenging.
