title: Classic FSI Black Brant II Kit
description: >
  I have a classic FSI Black Brant II kit from thed 70's/80's that I'm going to build.
  The kit is in great shape and I wanted to do it justice by building it to the highest
  standard.

My friend Jim from my local rocket club sold me a classic
FSI Black Brant II kit for an extremely reasonable price at the club's annual
event this year. The kit is in great shape and I wanted to do it justice by building
it extra special.

I haven't seen big chunks of balsa like this in a long time. The kit is really
a great example of high quality from 30+ years ago but the balsa has some very deep grain
so the finishing stages will be a bit more challenging.

The kit is a 1/8th scale model of the Black Brant II sounding rocket and since it is long
out of print, I've documented as best I can for posterity.

Starting with capturing all of the parts in Fusion 360, which made it easier to
understand the build process and also to create a simulation in OpenRocket.

The design details are over in the [project page](/projects/fsi-bbii). This is a cutaway view
to get an idea of the internal structure.

The forward section is a balse nose cone and plug on eiter end of airframe section.
