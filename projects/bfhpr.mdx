# Baby's First High-powered Rocket

## Background

My youngest son, Dalton, has been flying model rockets for many years. 
He has always been with me building and launching larger rockets and has been looking
forward to getting officially certified for high-powered rockets.

When Dalton found out that he could get his Level 1 certification when he turned 12,
the quest began.

Dalton flew his first rocket on 28 MAY 2016. He certified for Level 1 on 4 MAY 2024.
