# Baby's First High-powered Rocket

## Background

My youngest son, Dalton, has been flying model rockets for many years. 
He has always been with me building and launching larger rockets and has been looking
forward to getting officially certified for high-powered rockets.

When Dalton found out in late 2023 that he could get his Level 1 certification when he turned 12,
the quest began to get a rocket designed, built, and prepared for certification at the first launch
of the year in 2024.

Dalton flew his first rocket on 28 MAY 2016. He certified Level 1 on 4 MAY 2024.

There were many rockets in between. Some were successful, some were not but we
learned from each one and had a great time building and flying them.

## The Rocket

I have a fairly large selection of components (body tubing, nose cones, fins, etc.) that I have
collected over the years. I let Dalton pick out the components he wanted to use for his rocket.
The only real design constraint was that we needed to use parts we had on hand.

The rocket ended up with several parts from a Loc Expediter and the rest from parts "in stock". He
fabricated the fins and centreing rings from plywood.

Dalton designed the rocket starting in OpenRocket and transcribed the fins and centreing rings to
Fusion 360. All the plywood parts were then cut on the laser cutter from svg's exported from Fusion.

## Design and Fabrication Highlights

The fins and centreing rings were cut from 6mm plywood that I salvaged from a workbench that was
left in the house when we bought it. An old school workbench from the 1960's, which I still use the
frame for my 'more modern' MFT workbench.

It is very high quality plywood and I thought a fitting use for something special.
