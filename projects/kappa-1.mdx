In the mid-1950s, Japan's first space research group led by Prof. Hideo **Itokawa** embarked on developing indigenous sounding rockets. Experiments with the tiny **Pencil** (23 cm long) and **Baby** rockets laid the groundwork, but the upcoming International Geophysical Year (**IGY**, 1957–58) demanded vehicles that could reach 60–100 km altitude. Itokawa's team therefore **skipped directly to “Kappa”**, a solid-fuel rocket family tested at **Michikawa Beach** in Akita Prefecture.

Three single-stage Kappa-1 rockets flew in September 1956. Only 2.7 m long and 13 cm in diameter, they topped out at \~5 km but proved the solid-fuel concept. Seven launches by year-end ironed out fin flutter and case-overheating issues, clearing the way for staged variants.

## Historical Background and Development (circa 1956–58)

Development moved fast under tight budgets. The original **K-1** used **double-base propellant** in a steel case lined with ablative glass-fibre. By early 1957 the team began adding larger boosters and experimenting with **staged configurations**:

* **Kappa-2** (April 1957) – two-stage test with a 220 mm booster plus dummy upper stage; reached 9 km.
* **Kappa-3** (May 1957) – first live two-stage flight; three launches reached 21–22 km.
* **Kappa-4** (Sept 1957) – introduced **composite propellant** in a 330 mm booster; theoretical 80 km but flights under-performed.
* **Kappa-5** (Mar–May 1958) – hybrid (composite upper + double-base booster); hit \~30 km.
* **Kappa-6** (June 1958) – both stages composite; exceeded 60 km and met IGY goals.

## Kappa 1 Variants and Technical Specifications

| Variant            | Stages | Length | Diameter | Launch Mass | Apogee   | Propellant              |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------ | -------- | ----------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| **Kappa-1 (K-1)**  | 1      | 2.70 m | 0.13 m   | \~150 kg    | 5 km     | Double-base             |
| **Kappa-1A (K-2)** | 2      | 4.90 m | 0.22 m   | 166.7 kg    | 9 km     | Double-base             |
| **Kappa-1B (K-3)** | 2      | 4.90 m | 0.22 m   | 170 kg      | 22 km    | Double-base             |
| **Kappa-1C (K-4)** | 2      | 5.86 m | 0.33 m   | 364 kg      | 25 km\*  | Composite / Double-base |
| **Kappa-1D (K-5)** | 2      | 5.9 m  | 0.33 m   | \~340 kg    | 30 km    | Composite / Double-base |
| **Kappa-1E (K-6)** | 2      | 5.61 m | 0.25 m   | 255–270 kg  | 60–70 km | Composite               |

\*Flight data suggests \~25 km; design apogee was 80 km.

### Kappa-1 (Initial Model)

The single-stage **K-1** produced \~10 kN thrust for 3 s. Its **13 cm diameter** body kept weight down but limited propellant mass. An **ablative liner** protected the steel case, and four clipped-delta fins provided stability. Early flights carried only telemetry beacons and never broke 5 km but validated the design.

### Kappa-1A / Kappa-2 (Booster Testbed)

Adding a **220 mm booster** beneath a dummy K-1 created Kappa-2. The lone test on 24 April 1957 reached 9 km, confirming the booster's integrity and setting up the first live two-stage flights.

### Kappa-1B / Kappa-3 (First Two-Stage Rocket)

Kappa-3 swapped the dummy for a live upper stage. Three flights in May–June 1957 reached 22 km but revealed heating on booster fins. With both stages still on double-base propellant, altitude remained limited.

### Kappa-1C / Kappa-4 (Composite Booster)

K-4 introduced a **330 mm composite-fuel booster** delivering up to 105 kN. Combustion instability and overweight steel cases, however, capped real-world performance at \~25 km.

### Kappa-1D / Kappa-5 (Hybrid Propellant)

K-5 paired the proven 330 mm booster with a **150 mm composite upper stage**, hitting \~30 km and proving composite fuel's advantage.

### Kappa-1E / Kappa-6 (First High-Altitude Success)

Both stages now used composite propellant. On **16 June 1958** a K-6 lofted \~20 kg of instruments to **60 km**. Over a dozen flights through 1960 delivered data on winds, temperature and cosmic rays.

## Later Evolution and Legacy

The Kappa series paved the way for larger vehicles:

| Rocket     | First Launch | Stages | Max Altitude | Notes                    |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------ | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Kappa-1    | 1956         | 1      | 5 km         | First JP sounding rocket |
| Kappa-6    | 1958         | 2      | 60 km        | IGY success              |
| Kappa-8    | 1960         | 2      | 160–200 km   | Reached ionosphere       |
| Kappa-9L/M | 1961-63      | 3      | 350 km       | Three-stage              |
| Kappa-10S  | 1965         | 3      | 742 km       | High-apogee record       |

Technologies proven on Kappa 1—composite propellants, staging, spin stabilisation—fed into the **Lambda 4S**, which orbited Japan's first satellite in 1970.
