In the mid-1950s, Japan's first space research group led by Prof. Hideo Itokawa
at the University of Tokyo embarked on developing indigenous sounding rockets. 
Earlier experiments with the tiny Pencil rockets (only 23 cm long, 1.8 cm in 
diameter) and slightly larger Baby rockets laid the groundwork for a larger 
vehicle. The impetus came from the upcoming International Geophysical Year 
(IGY, 1957–58), which required sounding rockets to reach at least 60–10 km
altitude for meaningful upper-atmosphere research. Originally, the team had 
planned incremental steps through rockets code-named Alpha and Beta before 
tackling a bigger vehicle, but IGY's urgency forced them to skip directly to 
the “Kappa” rocket series, bypassing those intermediate stages. The result 
was the Kappa 1 – Japan's first large post-war sounding rocket family, 
developed at the Institute of Industrial Science (IIS) of the University of 
Tokyo, and tested at a new beach launch site in Michikawa, Akita Prefecture.

Development of Kappa 1 proceeded rapidly in 1956 under constrained resources. 
Prof. Itokawa's team chose a solid-fuel design (in contrast to the liquid-fuel 
sounding rockets like America's early Aerobee and France's Véronique) and 
leveraged double-base propellants (nitroglycerin/nitrocellulose based) that had 
been proven in the Baby rockets. By September 1956, the first Kappa 1 vehicles 
were ready for launch. Three Kappa rockets were fired in late September 1956, 
all single-stage rockets about 2.7m long and only 13cm in diameter. These 
early flights demonstrated basic functionality but only reached about 5km 
altitude each (far short of the 40km design goal), due in part to short burn 
times (~3s) and structural issues like fin flutter. Nevertheless, the 
successful firings on September 24, 28, and 29, 1956 marked Japan's first 
launches of the Kappa series and proved the solid-fuel concept viable. 
Seven Kappa-1 single-stage rockets were launched by the end of 1956, 
gradually resolving issues such as motor case overheating (mitigated by an 
ablative glass fiber/chromium oxide lining inside the steel motor casing) and 
fin vibrations.
