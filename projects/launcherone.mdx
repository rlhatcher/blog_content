Virgin Orbit, a subsidiary of the Virgin Group, ventured into the commercial
space industry with a unique approach: air-launching rockets. This method,
involving launching rockets from a carrier aircraft in midair, promised greater
flexibility and responsiveness compared to traditional ground-launched rockets.
The concept aimed to revolutionise satellite deployment, particularly for
small satellites, by offering a more cost-effective and versatile launch solution.

The design and production of LauncherOne, under the aegis of Virgin Orbit, took
place in their Long Beach, California facility. This centre of innovation was
crucial for marrying the traditional aspects of rocket engineering with the
unconventional approach of air-launch technology. The centrepiece of this project
was the integration with Cosmic Girl, a modified Boeing 747-400, epitomising the
venture's ingenuity. Virgin Orbit's commitment here was not just to develop a
new rocket but to redefine the parameters of satellite launch systems, making
them more accessible and adaptable for smaller payloads.

## Development of LauncherOne

LauncherOne was developed as a two-stage orbital launch vehicle. Designed to be
carried aloft by a modified Boeing 747-400, named Cosmic Girl, it represented
a novel approach in the small satellite market. The rocket was capable of
carrying payloads up to 500 kilograms into a Sun-synchronous orbit, targeting
a niche market of small satellites. Throughout its development, LauncherOne
underwent various design iterations and improvements, reflecting the evolving
needs of the satellite industry.
