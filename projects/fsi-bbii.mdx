# A Classic Kit of a Classic Rocket

The famous FSI catalogs of the early years featured the very nice looking 1/8 scale model of the Black Brant - II, probably one of the best looking rockets around (maybe, after the Saturn 1-B).

Manufactured 1974-1994, the kit is high-quality and traditional in design.
