I stumbled on a thread in the Rocketry Forum from Peter Alway describing an 8 cm rocket he found as part of his ongoing research. [^1]

[^1]: Peter has produced a significant body of work documenting rockets

Amazingly detailed drawings of the Rakete Sprenggranate were made by the allies and are stored in the Australian national archive [@ARD1945]
