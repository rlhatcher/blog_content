# Japan's Baby Rocket

## Contents

## Background

There are two-stage types of babies, S-type, T-type, and R-type, and they were launched from August to December 1955, all of which reached an altitude of about 6 km. [@Xie2016] In the S-type, we packed smoke agents and confirmed the flight performance by optical tracking of the smoke. The T-type is a rocket equipped with the first telemeter in Japan, which is the crystallisation of the efforts of Takagi, Nomura and electric manufacturers, and the R-type is equipped with a photographic machine by Tsuneyoshi Uemura, and succeeded in experimenting to recover it in the sky. It was Japan's first collection of installed equipment.

> Baby rockets are quite good, and the first thing is that I was able to go before exceeding the speed of sound. At that time, there was no way to measure the speed, so it was computationally, but I don't think it was exceeded. Baby S type is the first. The next baby T-type put a telemeter on it for the first time. This was the turn of Mr. Noboru Takagi and Mr. Nomuraya. I also remember making one measuring instrument and one one for the accelerometer, but this didn't work. Anyway, it was a big story to put a telemeter on it. The last baby R-type was also collected with a parachute and a buoy. This was also not working on the installed equipment, but I only collected it. However, it meant that it did all the functions as a basic observation rocket. The altitude was very low, but it's quite a big deal that I did it in the same year. (Akiba)
