# Japan's Baby Rocket

## Contents

## Background

The baby rocket was the second step in Japanese rocket development.
The two-stage rocket had an outer diameter of 8 cm, a total length of 120 cm, and a weight of about 10 kg.; Fuji Precision had already conducted a previous combustion experiment. [@AgeBabyHistory]

The baby rocket was the transition from the initial pencil rockets to full-scale operational sounding rockets.

> Baby rockets are quite good, and the first thing is that I was able to go before exceeding the speed of sound. At that time, there was no way to measure the speed, so it was computationally, but I don't think it was exceeded. Baby S type is the first. The next baby T-type put a telemeter on it for the first time. This was the turn of Mr. Noboru Takagi and Mr. Nomuraya. I also remember making one measuring instrument and one one for the accelerometer, but this didn't work. Anyway, it was a big story to put a telemeter on it. The last baby R-type was also collected with a parachute and a buoy. This was also not working on the installed equipment, but I only collected it. However, it meant that it did all the functions as a basic observation rocket. The altitude was very low, but it's quite a big deal that I did it in the same year.
