# Japan's Baby Rocket

## Contents

## Background

The baby rocket was the second step in Japanese rocket development.
The baby rocket was the transition from the initial pencil rockets to full-scale
operational sounding rockets.

> Baby rockets are quite good, and the first thing is that I was able to go
before exceeding the speed of sound. At that time, there was no way to measure
the speed, so it was computationally, but I don't think it was exceeded. Baby S
type is the first. The next baby T-type put a telemeter on it for the first time.
This was the turn of Mr. Noboru Takagi and Mr. Nomuraya. I also remember making
one measuring instrument and one one for the accelerometer, but this didn't work.
Anyway, it was a big story to put a telemeter on it. The last baby R-type was
also collected with a parachute and a buoy. This was also not working on the
installed equipment, but I only collected it. However, it meant that it did all
the functions as a basic observation rocket. The altitude was very low, but it's
quite a big deal that I did it in the same year.

The two-stage rocket had an outer diameter of 8 cm, a total length of 120 cm,
and a weight of about 10 kg.; Fuji Precision had already conducted a previous
combustion experiment.

### Types

There were three types of the baby rocket

| Type | Feature |
| -- | -- |
| T | Transmitter |
| S | Smoke |
| R | Parachute |
