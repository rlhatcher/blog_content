title: Classic FSI Black Brant II Kit
description: >
  I have a classic FSI Black Brant II kit from thed 70's/80's that I'm going to build.
  The kit is in great shape and I wanted to do it justice by building it to the highest
  standard.

My friend Jim from my local rocket club sold me a classic
FSI Black Brant II kit for an extremely reasonable price at the club's annual
event this year. The kit is in great shape and I wanted to do it justice by building
it extra special.

I haven't seen big chunks of balsa like this in a long time. The kit is really
a great example of high quality from 30+ years ago but the balsa has some very deep grain
so the finishing stages will be a bit more challenging.

The kit is a 1/8th scale model of the Black Brant II sounding rocket and since it is long
out of print, I've documented as best I can for posterity.

Starting with capturing all of the parts in Fusion 360, which made it easier to
understand the build process and also to create a simulation in OpenRocket.

The design details are over in the [project page](/projects/fsi-bbii). This is a cutaway view
to get an idea of the internal structure.

## Motor Mount

Overall, this is a well understood design and straight forward to build. I like the stuffer tube
approach. Especially since the airframe tubing is very lightweight. The [build
and individual steps](/builds/fsi-bbii) cover the process in detail.

The only required modification was to adapt the originasl motor mount to 24mm. The [FSI motors
that the rocket was designed](https://www.rocketreviews.com/fsi-f100.html) for were 27mm.

This is a view of the motor assembly with the additional centering rings and the 24mm motor tube.

I took the opportunity to add an Aeropack retainer to the motor mount, is a great benefit
when using 24mm reloads. I cut the centering rings from 6mm plywood and the motor tube is 24mm
standard issue Estes.

Using JB Weld to attach these componets gives a good solid mount for the F motors I have in store for it.

## Recovery System

I added my own recovery setup, replacing the original with a spliced kevlar cord and heavier weight swivel.

## Finishing

I really wanted to do a good job on the finish. I used a lot of filler and sanding to get the balsa
smooth. I used a combination of sanding sealer and primer to get a good base for the paint.

All the details are in the [build section](/builds/fsi-bbii) and I'm really happy with the results.
