  This is a design I have been iterating on since 2018 and have finally arrived at a simple and
  repeatably reliable system.

The weather has not been cooperating this season. We have had gusty conditions for both of the weekend events
that we've been able to attend. This has delayed the high-power test program, but the gusty conditions
provided surprisingly good performance for the low-power version of the Baby Rocket.

We went to [Midland Rocketry Club](https://midlandrocketryclub.org/) for the June weekend event and Saturday was windy.
Very windy. Later in the afternoon, the wind calmed enough to make models a reasonable option. We flew the sustainer
as a standard low-power configuration with a C6-9 motor. It was a bit ambitious for the conditions as the rocket
performed better than expectations. It handled the wind brilliantly without weathercock and flew straight to
what seemed 1000+ feet. Without an altimeter on board, we don't have an exact altitude, but it was a great flight.

Sunday weather was much better and we went for a staged flight using a B6-0 booster to B6-6 sustainer. The booster
performed well and the gap staging worked as expected. The sustainer ignited and flew well. The shock line detached
when the ejection charge fired and the parachute and nosecone drifted off over the Leicestershire countryside. I
suspect never to be seen again. The sustainer landed safely and was recovered along with the booster.

Again, the rocket performance was fantastic. The next low-power flight will be a C6-0 booster to C6-9 sustainer
to manage a good sized payload.

The high-power test program is still on hold until the weather cooperates. We will have to see what the summer brings.
In the meantime, the siblings will have to wait patiently for their turn to fly.
