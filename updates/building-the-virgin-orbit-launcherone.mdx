## Overview

The orbital launch attempt from the UK proved to be a failure. The rocket was
lost due to a failure of the second stage. The first stage performed well and
the rocket was recovered. The second stage was not recovered and the rocket
was lost.

There was a great amount of excitement in the rocket community here and I was
really taken by the aesthetics of the rocket. I decided to build a scale
model, and here we are.

## Design

The scale was decided based on the standard Loc Precision 4" airframe and
after some initial simulations, I decided to go with a 38mm motor mount.
This would allow me to fly the rocket on a variety of motors from H to J
and still be in a sensible altitude for the flying sites here in the UK.

I initially looked a several tube options for the payload section, but in
the end decided to print the entire forward airframe. This would allow me
to have a flexible avionics bay that could be configured for single or dual
deploy and allow multiple options for weight distribution.

The strength of the build is in the fincan and central support structure.
The approach I've adopted recently for all of my scratch builds follwos the
slotted fin/ centreing ring approach. This allows me to build a very strong
structure that is easy to assemble and align.
