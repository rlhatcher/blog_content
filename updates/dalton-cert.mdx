Dalton has been flying model rockets for many years. He has always been with me building and launching
larger rockets and has been looking forward to getting officially certified for high-powered rockets.

When Dalton found out in late 2023 that he could get his Level 1 certification when he turned 12, the quest
began to get a rocket designed, built, and prepared for certification at the first launch of the year in 2024.
