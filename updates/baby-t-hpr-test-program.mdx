Planned test flights

## Test flight 01

The first test flight was planned for Big Ears 2025 but the conditions were not ideal.

I have re-thought the need for this flight and have decided to skip it. The rocket is 1:1 scale of
a rocket proven to fly well. Moving straight to the dual-deploy test flight is the best option.

Configuration:

- Sustainer Only
- Single deploy
- Motor Ejection

Electronics:

- Stratologger CF - Logging only
- Trullock Grissom - Logging only

## Test flight 02

The second test flight is planned for Midland sumner skies 2025.

Configuration:

- Single stage only
- Dual deploy
- Motor Ejection - backup

Electronics:

- Stratologger CF - primary recovery
- Grissom - backup recovery
- EasyTimer - stage ignition

The StratoLogger fires both drogue and main charges.
The Grissom will fire a main charge at alt - 100ft
The EasyTimer will log flight data for analysis.

## Test flight 03

The third test flight is planned for Big Ears 2025.

Configuration:

- Full Stack
- Single deploy
- Single stage
