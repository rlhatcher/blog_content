I'm writing this long after completing the build, but I wanted to document some
of the things I learned along the way. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail
about the build itself, but I'll try to cover some of the things I learned along
the way.

This turned into a much bigger project than I expected. I thought I'd be able to
build it in a few months, but it ended up taking over a year. I'm not sure how
much of that was spent scouring the internet for information, and how much was
spent actually building, but it was a lot of time.

It became one of those projects that I really connected with and poured a lot of
myself into. I'm really proud of the result and get great satisfaction seeing it
on the shelf.

Anyway, here are some of the things I learned along the way. and a video of the
maiden launch.

## The Loc Precision Phoenix kit is a great starting point

As an expert level kit, there are no instructions but the parts are excellent
quality materials and fabricated to high precision. Everything fits as it should
and presents a lot of scope for customisation.

The nosecone is an exceptions here. The kit is supplied with a standard Loc 7.5"
ogive nosecone, which is a heavy duty part and great for normal use. The Phoenix
requires a Phoenix nosecone and I fabricated that myself. The difference is
remarkable.

Otherwise, I built the kit largely as intended.

The details for the nosecone fabrication are over in
the [build section]('/builds/phoenix-missile/nosecone')
