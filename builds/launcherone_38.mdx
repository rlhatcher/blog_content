# Prototype 38mm Launcherone

This is a prototype of the Launcherone rocket. It is a 4" diameter booster with
a 38mm motor mount. It is designed to fly from H to J motors and has a flexible
avionics bay that can be configured for dual deploy or single deploy.

## Contents

The build for this configuration is pretty straight forward and the design almost
ensures a straight and true build.

The main components are standard airframe and plywood. The payload section is 3D printed
allowing for a flexible avionics bay configuration.
