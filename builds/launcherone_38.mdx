# Prototype 38mm Launcherone

This is a prototype of the Launcherone rocket. It is a 4" diameter booster with
a 38mm motor mount. It is designed to fly from H to J motors and has a flexible
avionics bay that can be configured for dual deploy or single deploy.

## Contents

The build for this configuration is pretty straight forward and the design almost
ensures a straight and true build.

The main components are standard airframe and plywood. The payload section is 3D printed
allowing for a flexible avionics bay configuration. Here are the fins, centreing rings and
the motor mount.

## Build Process

We start with the fincan. The fins are slotted into the centreing rings and the motor mount
is attached. This prodives a very strong structure that is easy to align. You will end up
with somehting like this.

The nextstep is to bond the fincan to the airframe. This is done with a good round of epoxy
and sliding the fincan into place. The fincan is then aligned and the epoxy is allowed to cure.
