The overall design relies on the fincan as the core, structural, component. 

Slotting the fins into the centring rings and against the motor mount produces a strong
box structure.

In the second iteration, triangles were etched into the motor mount edge of the centring rings, which aligned
to the fin slots. These allow for precise alignment of the centring rings and subsequently the fins.
