  Building the Baby-T is much like a puzzle-box. Fitting electronics into the middle is a challenge.
  Especially with three flight computers and the corresponding batteries.

The avionics bay is designed to fit into the middle of the rocket, with a
spine that runs through the center. This allows for easy access to the avionics 
and provides a stable platform for the altimeters and batteries.

The steel rod spine provides support for the 3D printed sled and also rigidity
to support the recovery system.

The avionics bay has M5 lifting eye attachments points forward and aft, which are 
directly connected by M5 threaded rod.

## Avionics

The avionics carries three altimeters, 4 2S LiPo batteries and a 1S LiPo battery. The 1S battery powers the staging timer.

| Device       | Purpose          | Notes                                              |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| EasyTimer    | Stage Ignition   | tilt detection and timer for stage ignition        |
| StratoLogger | Primary Recovery | Main altimeter, 2S lipo with resistor for charge   |
| Grissom      | Backup Recovery  | Backup altimeter, dedicated 2S battery for charges |

### Altus Metrum EasyTimer

The EasyTimer is a staging timer that uses tilt detection and other parameters to determine when to safely ignite the second stage. It is powered by a 1S LiPo battery and has a 2S LiPo battery for the charges.

## Ejection Charges

Charges are held in centrifuge tubes, which are held by a 3D printed well that bolts
through the bulkhead. This approach allows for easy connection of igniters using
thumb-friendly connectors and provides a secure way to hold the charges in place.
