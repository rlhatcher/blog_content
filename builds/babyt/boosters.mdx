  The booster sections are nearly identical. The only difference is the addition of the inter-stage
  mounting for the first stage and plumbing for the staging ignition system in the second stage.

The fincan is built using a standard slotted fin and ring approach, which provides 
structural integrity and precision alignment for the fins.The fin tabs extend to the
tail-cone/inter-stage section, ensuring the assembly stays square and aligned.

The design uses two almost identical fincans, one with recovery attachments and
one with plumbing for the staging system. Both have recovery attachments and
spliced kevlar lines for the recovery system.

Slotted phenolic airframe slides on to the fin-can and is secured to the tail-cone
surface. The first stage booster inter-stage sdapter slides into the phenolic
coupler in the tail-cone.

The 3D printed tail-cone is lined with a phenolic airframe tube that provides heat
protection for the 3D printed part and also provides a surface for the booster
stage to attach to.

The inter-stage design allows for easily flying a single-stage using dual deployment.
