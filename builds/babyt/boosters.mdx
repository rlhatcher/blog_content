  The booster sections are nearly identical. The only difference is the addition of the inter-stage
  mounting for the first stage and plumbing for the staging ignition system in the second stage.

Slotted phenolic airframe slides on to the fin-can and is secured to the tail-cone
surface. The first stage booster inter-stage sdapter slides into the phenolic
coupler in the tail-cone.

The 3D printed tail-cone is lined with a phenolic airframe tube that provides heat
protection for the 3D printed part and also provides a surface for the booster
stage to attach to.

The inter-stage design allows for easily flying a single-stage using dual deployment.
