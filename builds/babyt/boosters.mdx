  The booster sections are nearly identical. The only difference is the addition of the inter-stage
  mounting for the first stage and plumbing for the staging ignition system in the second stage.

The tail-cone is a 3D printed part that acts as a fin-aligner and inter-stage mount.
The 3D printed tail-cone is lined with a phenolic airframe tube that provides heat
protection for the 3D printed part and also provides a surface for the booster
stage to attach to.

The inter-stage design allows for easily flying a single-stage using dual deployment.
