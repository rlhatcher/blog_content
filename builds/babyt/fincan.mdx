  The fincan uses my standard slotted fin and ring approach with the addition of the inter-stage
  mounting and plumbing for the staging system.

The fincan is built using a standard slotted fin and ring approach, which provides 
structural integrity and precision alignment for the fins.The fin tabs extend to the
tail-cone/inter-stage section, ensuring the assembly stays square and aligned.

The design uses two almost identical fincans, one with recovery attachments and
one with plumbing for the staging system. Both have recovery attachments and
spliced kevlar lines for the recovery system.
