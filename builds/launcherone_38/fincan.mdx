# Rock solid

The core of the build is the fin can. If this is strong and straight, the rest of the build will be easy.

## Materials

### Motor Mount

The first step involves bonding the motor retainer and aft centring ring to the motor tube. [JB Weld](https://www.jbweld.com) is the traditional choice and there's absolutely no reason not to carry on the tradition by using a generous amount of high-temp to the aft of the motor tube and sliding the aft centring ring to meet the retainer.

### Forward Centring Ring

We simply fasten the eye bolt using a washer and nut.
