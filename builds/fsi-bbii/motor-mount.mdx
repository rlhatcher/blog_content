# Small modifications requied

The origianl mount is desinged for FSI 27mm motors. I made a small adapter using
a standard issue Estes 24mm motor mount. I lasered a couple of centreing rings and
added an Aeropack retainer.

The tailcone has centring rings glued to each side, with the motor tube passing through.

I used JB Weld for all the motor mount bonding. It's a great adhesive for this kind of work.
