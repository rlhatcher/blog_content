The fincan is the core of the build, providing the structure and alignment for the rest of the 
rocket. The fins are slotted into the fincan and bonded in place to ensure they are straight and secure.

The build starts by fitting the centreing rings to the core aft tube. I used the fins for precise alignment
and to ensure the rings are square to the tube. Alignment lines are drawn on the tube to ensure the ring
slots are aligned.

All of the fins are tacked into place ensureing everything is straight.

The fins, centreing rings and core tube are bonded together with epoxy. The u-bolts
are also installed and epoxyed in place.

That's it for the fincan. The next step is to build the motor mount.
