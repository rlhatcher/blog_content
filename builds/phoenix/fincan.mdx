# The entire build relies on the strenth and straightness of the fincan

The fincan is the core of the build, providing the structure and alignment for the rest of the 
rocket. The fins are slotted into the fincan and bonded in place to ensure they are straight and secure.

The build starts by fitting the centreing rings to the motor mount tube. I used the fins for precise alignment
and to ensure the rings are square to the tube. Alignment lines are drawn on the tube to ensure the ring
slots are aligned.

All of the fions are tacked into place ensureing everything is straight.
