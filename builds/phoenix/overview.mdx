The build is based on the Loc Precision kit so the main parts are the
same as the kit. The modifications I made are the nose cone, the fins
and the motor mount. The nose cone is a 3D printed part, the fins are
made from plywood and the fin mounts are a combination of 3D printed parts
and fibreglass.

Each build section will have a detailed description of the parts and techniques used.

The general steps are:
1. Fincan / motor mount
1. booster section
1. fibreglass
1. Avionics bay
1. Payload section
1. Nose cone
1. Finishing
