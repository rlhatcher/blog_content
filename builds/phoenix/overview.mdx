The build is based on the Loc Precision kit so the main parts are the same as the kit. The modifications I made are the nose cone, the fins and the motor mount. The nose cone is a 3D printed part, the fins are made from plywood and the fin mounts are a combination of 3D printed parts and fibreglass.

## Printing
For this build, I used my Prusa MK3 and MK2 using Prusament PETG filament.
