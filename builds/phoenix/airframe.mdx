# Adding the skin to the (very strong) bones

The airframe fin-slots are extended completely aft so the airframe slides on to the fincan
and butting to the fin forward edges.

The airframe is bonded to the centreing rings as it is slid into place.

The forward fins are slotted into the airframe slots ensuring they remain straight allong
their extended length.

Using painters tape on the aft centreing ring helps ensure the airframe is aligned and straight.
Once the epoxy cures, the tape is removed and the airframe is ready for the next step.
