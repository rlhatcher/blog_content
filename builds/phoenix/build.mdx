  The most advanced build I have undertaken to date. The build is based on the
  Loc Precision kit that I purchased during the lockdown. The note from Loc says it all really

My flavour of build prioritised two things

1. **Strength** Build as string as possible with the expectation that it will
fly with an 'M' motor at some point
2. **Aesthetics** Build as scale as possible

The first priority gave me n opportunity to do some tip to tip fibreglassing,
which was my first attempt. I also built the fin-can externally for maximum
strength and straightness.

The build steps go into details for each of these techniques.

The second priority involved an enormous amount of research and thought.
The [project page](/projects/phoenix) covers the details of the research.
The fin mounts and antennae radomes are such an iconic part of this missile
that they were absolutely required. Again, the build steps go through the
particulars of these items.

## The nose cone

The nose cone deserves a special mention. I orginally used the ogive cone
suppplied with the kit. However, I was never happy with it. It was too long
and gave the entire rocket a different look.

I ended up making a new nose cone from scratch that brought the overall length
down slightly but made a massive difference with the scale look. The build steps
cover the details of this process.
