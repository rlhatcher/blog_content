The design of the avionics bay is unconventional in that the bay itself is only half the length
of the coupler. This is to make room for the drogue parachute which will be housed in the aft
section.

The approach requires cutting a [Loc Precision Stiffner](https://locprecision.com/products/tube-coupler-stiffener?variant=39778637021375) 
in half (more or less) and adding the bulkheads to the forward section. the stiffner in the aft end 
butts to the forward coupler of the booster.
